    "\n",
    "In this notebook and the next we will illustrate the benefit of pretraining your network on a very large dataset that is only somewhat related to the task you want to solve. In our case we will pretrain on MNIST digits to help solve the fashion MNIST dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we train a small fully connected network using only 300 examples. This is to simulate what it is like to only have a small dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "After this in the next notebook we will pretrain a more complex model on MNIST digits, and then use that trained network for fashion MNIST with only 300 examples. Hopefully we get better performance than here.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a real world setting you would use a network pretrained on ImageNet or similar and apply it to your use case (say rock, paper, scissors). However training on ImageNet still takes too long for a classroom setting so we have to make do with these smaller toy sets."
