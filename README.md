# Deep Learning Class

A three day course on deep learning.

The repository will be updated during the course so make sure to check it
every morning.

# Setup

You will need a conda environment with Python 3.6 and the following packages:
* scikit-learn
* keras=2.1.6
* tensorflow=1.5.1
* matplotlib
* numpy
* jupyter

Where no version is specified the latest version of the package on conda-forge
should work.

Create a new conda environment with `conda create -n deep-image-class python=3.6`,
then activate it and install the packages with `conda install -c conda-forge <packagename>`.

We will install additional libraries during the course.
